# PythonBytes


A great podcast. A terrible python package.

```
pip install pythonbytes
```

Episode #239 made me do this late at night. Feel free to have some fun here. Respect work those guys put into the show and don't slam their servers with requests.


Downloading an episode so that you can listen to it on the road:
```
from pythonbytes.download import download_episode

download_episode(episode_number=239)
```
Now you have `239.mp3` written in whatever folder you're working in.
